### 🚀 About Me

I craft cross-platform mobile experiences that don’t just work — they **wow**.  
With **3+ years** in the game, I’ve shipped production apps packed with features like real-time messaging, map integration, secure payments, and deep linking.

I'm all about writing **clean, maintainable code**, implementing **robust state management**, and creating **pixel-perfect UIs** that perform.
